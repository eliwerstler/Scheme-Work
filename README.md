# Scheme Programming Examples

## Overview

This repo features a collection of small programs I wrote in **Scheme**. Scheme is a super lightweight, functional programming language that’s great for learning and solving complex problems with minimal code.

## Why Scheme?

- **Simple and clean**: Scheme’s syntax is minimal, so you can focus on the logic rather than the noise.
- **Great for algorithms**: It’s a perfect fit for recursion, list processing, and other foundational programming concepts.
- **Functional programming**: Scheme teaches you to think in a functional way, which can make your code more modular and easier to debug.

## How to Run

To run these examples, install a Scheme interpreter like **Racket** or **Guile**, then:
**racket filename.scm**
